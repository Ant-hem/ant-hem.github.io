# About me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Antoine, a passionate Software Engineer working & living in France.
I am writing articles about `C++, C#, Java` and other stuff I like.

I am an open-source enthusiast, member of the [.NET Foundation](https://dotnetfoundation.org/), working on [Algolia's](https://www.algolia.com/) Search Engine and also a maintainer of the [.NET](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-csharp) and [Java](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-java-2) libraries of Algolia.

Don't be a stranger and say hi!
